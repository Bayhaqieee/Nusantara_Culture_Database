## Features
- **Batik Dataset**: A comprehensive dataset containing **2,900 images** of Batik patterns across **15 classes**, sourced from **Kaggle**.
- **Model Training**: Fine-tuned **MobileNetV2** using **TensorFlow** for high-accuracy Batik pattern classification.
- **Deployment Ready**: The trained model is converted to **.tflite format** for easy deployment to mobile or cloud platforms.
